About this app:
This site consists of two pages. On the first page, the tourist areas of the world are displayed and the user can bookmark the desired areas. Then, the user can enter the bookmark page through the link embedded in the header and see the areas he/she has already selected. Also, the number of items bookmarked by the user is displayed live next to the bookmark page link in the header. In addition, the "go to top" button has also been placed on the site. Redux Toolkit is used to manage states.
